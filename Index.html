      <p id="media-portrayal"> Media portrayal of Luigi could be crucial in Luigi's sentencing. Depending on jury selection, Luigi will either be charged by people who see him as a robin hood type, fighting  for the people against capitalism, or he will be charged by people who get the media's portrayal of him as a ruthless killer. The ladder is what the media often shows latter, such as in the image below.

      Treatment of Luigi Mangione
      </h2>

      
      <p id="treatment of luigi P"> luigi has not been treated kindly by the FBI, the news, law enforcement, the prisons, or the president.
      Lets look at the facts, Luigi Mangioni shot 1 person, the person he shot, Brian thompson, was a murderer, responsable for the death of countless people. The FBI and Local law enforcement put an incredible amouont of effort into catching luigi, offering around $60,000 for tips leading to his capture (which they never intended on paying).
      
      
      in 2024, there were at least 377 Murders in New York City, why didnt the murders of over 300 people have a $60,000 bounty, but the "murderer" of a rich, old, white man did?
      
      Luigi was turned in by a snitch working at McDonalds, looking for a $60,000 reward which, as far as we know, she neer recieved. Luigi was then put into fedral custidy, with an image surfacing of law enforcment roughly grabbing is neck, which suffers from cronic pain (see image above). According to fellow inmates he has not been treatedd well.
      
      during transport, Luigi was paraded around, in  a prison jumpsuit, hands and feet handcuffed together, surrounded by FBI agents holding ARs. This was a completely unnecisary display of power, sending a clear message "Dont fuck with the elits".
