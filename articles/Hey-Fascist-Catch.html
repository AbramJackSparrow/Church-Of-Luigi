<h1>Charlie Kirk dead after shooting at a Utah collage; "Hey fascist, catch!" reads an unfired bullet.</h1>
<p id="charliekirk">
In the 48 hours since the death of charlie kirk my opinions have shifted. My initial reaction was that of joy, that may sound crass to many, but ill use this article to explain myself. 
<br>
<br>
Please note that I do not write on behalf of any members of the Church of Luigi, I am simply sharing my opinion to a growing community of political activists, some like minded, some not.
<br>
<br>
I am sad. Not because Charlie Kirk died, but on a human level I am sad because another person died from gun violence. I do not recommend you attempt to find the video of Kirk's death, it is incredibly graphic and brutal, and, as much as I despise Charlie Kirk and the legacy of hatred he left behind, there are very few people I would wish that death upon, and charlie kirk was not one of them. He is survived by his wife and kids. His wife and 3 year old daughter were in attendance at the Utah college the day he was assassinated. I feel no sympathy for his wife, but I have an overwhelming amount of sympathy and empathy for his children, whose fathers brutal assassination will forever be viewable on the internet.
<br>
<br>
Despite everything I've just said, I am certainly not upset at his death. Charlie Kirk was a capitalist who made his millions exploiting college students, and peddling racist lies. 
<br>
<br>
“Happening all the time in urban America, prowling Blacks go around for fun to go target white people, that’s a fact. It’s happening more and more.”
<br>
<br>
When asked if his 10 year old daughter would have to deliver a baby were she raped, his response was “The answer is yes, the baby would be delivered.”
<br>
<br>
By his logic, his death would be “worth it” for the 2nd amendment: “I think it’s worth it to have a cost of, unfortunately, some gun deaths every single year so that we can have the second amendment to protect our other God-given rights. That is a prudent deal. It is rational.”
<br>
<br>
He also believed in and propagated the great replacement theory “The American Democrat party hates this country. They wanna see it collapse. They love it when America becomes less white”
<br>
<br>
If you want more evidence of him being a horrible person, I point you to the article: https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/11/charlie-kirk-quotes-beliefs
<br>
<br>
THE OUTCOME:
<br>
There's no way of knowing what will come of this; but the right is calling for war. Shocking.
<br>
Many on the right are making the claim that 'the left has declared war, and its fight or die' dispite, at the time of writing, we are sill unaware of the shooters identity, much less motive, and the fact that right wing political violence is more common and violent than leftist violence*
While I was writing this article, a suspect, Tyler Robinson, was arrested. I will keep everyone updated.
