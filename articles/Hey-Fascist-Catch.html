    <h1>
      Charlie Kirk dead after shooting at a Utah college; "Hey fascist, catch!"
      reads an unfired bullet.
    </h1>
<p id=charliekirk>
    In the 48 hours since the death of Charlie Kirk, my opinions have shifted. My
    initial reaction was that of joy, which may sound crass to many, but I'll use
    this article to explain myself.
    <br />
    <br />
    Please note that I do not write on behalf of any members of the Church of
    Luigi, I am simply sharing my opinion with a growing community of political
    activists, some like-minded, some not.
    <br />
    <br />
    I am sad. Not because Charlie Kirk died, but on a human level, I am sad
    because another person died from gun violence. I do not recommend you
    attempt to find the video of Kirk's death; it is incredibly graphic and
    brutal, and, as much as I despise Charlie Kirk and the legacy of hatred he
    left behind, there are very few people I would wish that death upon, and
    Charlie Kirk was not one of them. He is survived by his wife and kids. His
    wife and 3-year-old daughter were in attendance at the Utah college the day
    he was assassinated. I feel no sympathy for his wife, but I have an
    overwhelming amount of sympathy and empathy for his children, whose father's
    brutal assassination will forever be viewable on the internet.
    <br />
    <br />
    Despite everything I've just said, I am certainly not upset at his death.
    Charlie Kirk was a capitalist who made his millions exploiting college
    students and peddling racist lies.
    <br />
    <br />
    “Happening all the time in urban America, prowling Blacks go around for fun
    to target white people, that’s a fact. It’s happening more and more.”
    <br />
    <br />
    When asked if his 10-year-old daughter would have to deliver a baby were she
    raped, his response was “The answer is yes, the baby would be delivered.”
    <br />
    <br />
    By his logic, his death would be “worth it” for the 2nd amendment: “I think
    It’s worth it to have a cost of, unfortunately, some gun deaths every single
    year so that we can have the second amendment to protect our other God-given
    rights. That is a prudent deal. It is rational.”
    <br />
    <br />
    He also believed in and propagated the great replacement theory, “The
    The American Democrat party hates this country. They wanna see it collapse. They
    love it when America becomes less white”
    <br />
    <br />
    If you want more evidence of him being a horrible person, I point you to the
    article:

    <br />
    <br />
    THE OUTCOME:
    <br />
    There's no way of knowing what will come of this, but the right is calling
    for war. Shocking.
    <br />
    Many on the right are claiming that 'the left has declared war, and
    It's fight or die, despite the fact that, at the time of writing, we are still unaware of
    the shooter's identity, much less motive, and the fact that right-wing
    Political violence is more common and violent than leftist violence* While I
    While I was writing this article, a suspect, Tyler Robinson, was arrested. I will
    keep everyone updated.
