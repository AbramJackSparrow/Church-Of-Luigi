<p id="I-am-a-terrorist">I feel the need to clarify; this title is clickbait, I am not a terrorist… right? This article writes on the implications of antifa being designated as a terrorist organization, and why, even though I'm not a “member of antifa,” that may not matter. 
<br>
<br>
The leftist “”organization”” ANTIFA (Anti Fascist Action) has been designated as a domestic terrorist organization via an executive order on September 22, 2025. There is one major problem with this: ANTIFA is not an organization. It is completely decentralized, similar to the famous “anonymous", a name used by many “hacktivists”. Like Anonymous, ANTIFA is an idea more than it is a group; there is no leader, there are no "members", only a name, a title, used by like-minded activists. 
<br>
<br>
The White House knows this; designating antifa as a terrorist group will be used to persecute people who stand up to this administration.
<br>
<br>
<br>
Lies about antifa perpetrated by the White House:
<br>
<br>
 I will not break down every lie in the executive order; that would not value my time, or yours; what I will do is talk about a few of the lies in the executive order, and then write on what happens next for the whitehouse, and why they are doing this, as well as back up my previous claim of this being used to prosecute those who stand up to trump.
<br>
<br>
The white house wastes no time in getting to the lies. The title of the order is a lie; “DESIGNATING ANTIFA AS A DOMESTIC TERRORIST ORGANIZATION.” antifa is not solely domestic, nor is it an organization, and, while now they are terrorists in the eyes of the state, I do not believe they should be.
<br>
<br>
“Section 1.  Antifa as a Terrorist Threat.  Antifa is a militarist, anarchist enterprise that explicitly calls for the overthrow of the United States Government, law enforcement authorities, and our system of law.” This is the last time I will call out the fact that antifa is not an organized group, when the White House claims “antifa is” something, that language pushes a false narrative. When you look up antifa, you will see images of mostly skinny white people wearing all black, covering their faces, and waving flags. This is an image pushed by the media to perpetuate the narrative that antifa is a violent and angry group of rioters; the white house perpetuates this by calling them ‘violent militant antipolice anarchists who want a lawless world. This is simply not true. Some anarchists call themselves ANTIFA some individuals participate in violence against fascists under the name ANTIFA, but violence and anarchism are not inherent to the title, and all you have to do to learn this is read the first paragraph of the Wikipedia article. 
<br>  
“It uses illegal means to organize and execute a campaign of violence and terrorism nationwide to accomplish these goals.” I wish the white house would be specific about what illegal means to organize; the claim made in this statement is not “antifa organizes and executes illegal campaigns of violence…” The claim is specifically that illegal means are used to organize, so again I ask, what means of organization are considered illegal? 
<br>
“Antifa recruits, trains, and radicalizes young Americans to engage in this violence and suppression of political activity” the problematic framing of this propaganda piece continues; yes again i say, antifa is not an organization, there are no “coordinated efforts” to radicalize the youth, the closest thing to that would be the inverse of the “alt right pipeline”,  “the alt left pipeline”, if there is such a thing, is much less streamlined, and doesn't really lead to antifa. I will not deny that online leftist radicalization can lead to violence (such as in the case of Tyler Robinson, though I have some suspicion about the legitimacy of the case); however, the White House's claim that antifa has organized efforts to radicalize the youth into leftist violence is simply false. I also wonder how the author of this order thinks antifa “trains” these newly radicalized individuals. Does Antifa have a hidden headquarters used for training recruits in the ways of spinjitzu? And I want to be very clear when they say “violence and suppression of political activity,” they mean actual fascist and white supremacist “political activity”. The left is often accused of throwing around the word “fascist” too much, and to an extent I agree, but I also think there are a shocking amount of people who spread fascist rhetoric which allows fascism to grow in america without us even realizing; that being said, those are not normally who “ANTIFA” “targets” when there are a large volume of violent people using violence against others under the name antifa, it is, generally, against actual, blatant fascists and white supremacists such as those seen at Charlottesville. 
<br>
I will also point out that the alt-right pipeline leads to violence far more often than any alt-right pipeline. 
<br>
I could continue with the rest of the order like this. I’m about halfway through, but as I said earlier, that doesn't value either of our time. As such, I'll move on to the next topic.
<br>
<br>
You are a terrorist, and I am a terrorist

In an order passed on the same day
The following quote from the article has been re-formatted for your convenience, but the quote is unaltered:
<br>
<br>
“Common threads animating this violent conduct include
<br>
anti-Americanism
    <br>
Anti-capitalism
    <br>
and anti-Christianity;
    <br>
support for the overthrow of the United States Government;
    <br>
extremism on migration,
    <br>
[extremism on] race,
<br>
and [extremism on] gender;
    <br>
and hostility towards those who hold traditional American views on family,
    <br>
[hostility towards those who hold traditional American views on] religion,
    <br>
[hostility towards those who hold traditional American views] and morality.”
<br>
<br>
Let's break these down;
<br>
<br>
Anti-Americanism: This is disturbingly vague; it could mean anything from acknowledging and spreading true U.S. history to burning American flags (both of which are protected by the Constitution) 
<br>
<br>
Anti-capitalism: If you are reading this, if you support the CoL, you are likely anti-capitalist.
    <br>
<br>
Anti-Christianity: This is a term that is thrown around a lot, and there are real anti-theists and anti-Christians; however, many atheists are called anti-theists; most atheists are not anti-theists. This is just a step forward in Trump's Christian nationalist plan. 
<br>
<br>
Support for overthrow of the US government: it makes sense for the government to be against this, but it is telling for Trump to call this an anti fascist idea, almost as if he's aware many view his administration to be fascist.
<br>
<br>
extremism on migration: this means being anti-ICE, being against the abduction of, and the inhumane treatment of humans for the reason of lacking proper paperwork (article on ICE coming soon) 
<br>
<br>
[extremism on] race: Another incredibly vague statement, this could mean not accepting The Great Replacement Theory, or it could mean being against police discrimination. The vagueness of this is extremely frustrating and unsettling. I feel it very well could be used to persecute anyone left of center. 
<br>
<br>
[extremism on] gender: again, this is vague, but at its basic, it means supporting trans rights.
<br>
<br>
hostility towards those who hold traditional American views on family: “hostility towards” will all be vague, but “Traditional American views on family” means the nuclear family; it is not a stretch to see this twisted into calling for the eradication of gay marriage, and all who protest being labeled as antifa. I will demonstrate the rhetoric I expect to see at some point in the future. 
<br>
<br>
Members of government will attempt to overturn national protection of homosexual marriage with rhetoric such as ‘traditional family is one man and one woman, the way god intended, look to the example set by Adam and Eve. People would protest this, and they would be labeled as ‘hostile towards traditional American values on family, they would be labeled as antifa. 
<br>
<br>
[hostility towards those who hold traditional American views on] religion: this means advocating for the separation of church and state, such as not wanting the 10 commandments in schools, and using your First Amendment right to protest infringements on the separation of church and state.
<br>
<br>
[hostility towards those who hold traditional American views] and morality: I find this humorous, traditional American values, in my mind, can be separated into 2 categories: fascism, and anti-fascism, oppression and freedom, good and evil. Looking at almost every conflict, the British (authoritarian) vs colonials (not good people either, but better), the Confederacy (white supremacists) vs the Union, the Nazis vs the Allied powers. Throughout much of America's history, we were the lesser of two evils, we were the less morally reprehensible side against fascism and authoritarianism, we were the less morally reprehensible against white supremacy; but make no mistake, this is not what Trump means when he says American values.
<br>
<br>
Mark my words, this will be used to label anyone the government wants to as “part of a terrorist organization”. As of right now (Oct 1, 2025), it is not illegal to be part of a terrorist organization, but it does allow the government to forgo your rights. Essentially, being a part of a terrorist organization allows the government to spy on you in ways that normally wouldn't be legal without a warrant. 
<br>
<br>
If the current administration changes this, you will be updated immediately. 
<br>
<br>
Trump is afraid of anti-fascists, but you can't give into anticipatory submission; don't live in fear because these fascists tell you you must, be as loud as possible, and fight fascism.
