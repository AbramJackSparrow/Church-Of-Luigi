    <h1>
      Terrorism Charges Against Luigi Mangione Have Been Dropped
    </h1>

<p id=luigi-trerrorism-charges-dropped>Judge Gregory Carro, the judge overseeing Mangione's case, said he found the evidence to convict Luigi of terrorism “legally insufficient,” and he is absolutely correct; these charges were bogus, and only brought against him in an attempt to ensure the maximum possible sentence, and that is because Luigi scared them. The elites need us; we don't need them. 

Luigi will still be tried for second-degree murder and other weapons and forgery charges.</p>
