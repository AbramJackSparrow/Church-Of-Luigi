We occasionally use wikipedia as a source; this is not best practice and we acknowledge that.
<br>
So why do we still do it?
<br>
Well for one thing, we don’t use wikipedia as a source as an attempt to *prove* anything, only as a basic source for basic information that doesn't need an in depth source or as a starting point for further research. 
<br> 
In latter situation, it is explicitly stated and a sentence such as “we recommend you use this wikipedia article as a starting point for further research: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reliability_of_Wikipedia”
