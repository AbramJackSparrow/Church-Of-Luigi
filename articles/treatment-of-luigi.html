      <h1> 
      Treatment of Luigi Mangione
      </h1>

      
      <p id="treatment-of-luigi"> Luigi has not been treated kindly by the FBI, the news, law enforcement, the prisons, or the president.
      Let's look at the facts: Luigi Mangioni shot 1 person; the person he shot, Brian Thompson, was a murderer, responsible for the deaths of countless people. The FBI and Local law enforcement put an incredible amount of effort into catching Luigi, offering around $60,000 for tips leading to his capture (which they never intended on paying).
      
      
      In 2024, there were at least 377 Murders in New York City. Why didn't the murders of over 300 people have a $60,000 bounty, but the "murderer" of a rich, old, white man did?
      
      Luigi was turned in by a snitch working at McDonald's, looking for a $60,000 reward, which, as far as we know, she never received. Luigi was then put into federal custody, with an image surfacing of law enforcement roughly grabbing his neck, which suffers from chronic pain (see image above). According to fellow inmates, he has not been treated well.
      
      During transport, Luigi was paraded around in a prison jumpsuit, hands and feet handcuffed together, surrounded by FBI agents holding ARs. This was a completely unnecessary display of power, sending a clear message, "Don't fuck with the elites".
